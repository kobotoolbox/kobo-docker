# Environment variables

**All files within `./deployments` folder should be copied to `../kobo-deployments`.** 
They are only templates and must be modified to fit your needs.


Paths in composer files `../docker-compose.*.yml` are set to use this path.
If you want to use another path, be sure to update composer files.
